# jQuery Todo App

The goal of this  is to build a simple client-side JavaScript/jQuery "todo" app. Users of the app should see a list of finished items, a list of unfinished items, and a form with a single text field and a "Create" button to add new items. It should not be possible to add blank items. New items are unfinished by default, and move to finished when the user clicks a "Complete" button attached to the item. All items also have a "Delete" button that removes them from the app. Finally, items keep track of both the date/time they were created, and the date/time they were completed.
